\subsection{Case Study A: Financial Institution}

\subsubsection{Enterprise Context and Objectives}
This case examines a regulated financial institution exploring permissioned blockchain for interbank settlement and asset tokenization. Objectives include operational resilience, compliance alignment, and quantifiable ROI through process automation and reduced reconciliation overhead.

\subsubsection{System Architecture and Integration Touchpoints}
Summarize core systems (core banking, KYC/AML, custody/HSM, SIEM/SOC, API gateways) and blockchain platform components (consortium network, consensus mechanism, node topology, key management).

\subsubsection{Scope and Assumptions}
Define boundaries (pilot vs. production), data classification, participating entities, regulatory jurisdictions, and third-party dependencies.

\subsubsection{B-SAFE Checklist Application}
The following table captures checklist outcomes at the capability level. Status reflects current readiness; Score is an ordinal readiness measure (0â€“3); Gaps capture blockers; Owner is accountable function.

\subsubsection{Findings and Recommendations}
Provide prioritized remediation actions with rationale, dependencies, and expected impact.

\subsubsection{Deployment and Change Management Plan}
Outline phased rollout, environment promotion strategy, and rollback/kill-switch design.

\subsubsection{Residual Risk and Next Steps}
Document residual risks, sign-offs required, and plan for continuous monitoring and periodic reassessment.
