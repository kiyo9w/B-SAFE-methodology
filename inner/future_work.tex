\section{Reproducibility}
\label{sec:reproducibility}

A primary direction for extending the B-SAFE framework is through automation. To accelerate assessments and surface statistically-grounded risks, we have designed a prototype pipeline intended to complement, not replace, the core checklist and human review process.

\subsection{Additional Research Directions}
This section outlines potential directions for further research and development in the field, building on the findings of this study. Future work may include exploring additional blockchain platforms, enhancing data collection methods, or integrating advanced analytical techniques to gain deeper insights into blockchain security threats.

Future work may also involve the application of machine learning algorithms to predict security trends or the development of new frameworks for assessing the economic impact of security incidents. Additionally, expanding the scope to include user behavior analysis and its influence on security outcomes could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the blockchain security landscape.
