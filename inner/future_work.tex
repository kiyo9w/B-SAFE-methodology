\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

A primary direction for extending the B-SAFE framework is through continued automation and scale-up. Building on our implemented and evaluated LLM→XGBoost→LLM pipeline (\S\ref{sec:ml_pipeline}), future work will expand model families, broaden document modalities, and harden deployment for enterprise settings while maintaining human-in-the-loop governance.

\subsection{Additional Research Directions}
This section outlines potential directions for further research and development in the field, building on the findings of this study. Future work may include exploring additional blockchain platforms, enhancing data collection methods, or integrating advanced analytical techniques to gain deeper insights into blockchain security threats.

Future work may also involve the application of machine learning algorithms to predict security trends or the development of new frameworks for assessing the economic impact of security incidents. Additionally, expanding the scope to include user behavior analysis and its influence on security outcomes could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the blockchain security landscape.
