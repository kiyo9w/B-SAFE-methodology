\section{Incident Analysis}
\label{sec:incident_analysis}

This section presents the empirical application of the B-SAFE framework to real-world security incidents. We analyze critical risk categories for each layer of the blockchain architecture, providing a formal specification, defense mechanism analysis, and quantitative risk assessment based on our comprehensive dataset.

\caption{Temporal distribution of blockchain security incidents by architectural layer. Smart contract vulnerabilities consistently dominate, while DeFi protocol attacks surged during the 2020-2022 DeFi boom. Network and consensus layer incidents remain relatively rare but potentially catastrophic.}

Smart contract reentrancy attacks show the highest overall risk, while consensus layer attacks have the highest potential impact despite lower frequency.}
