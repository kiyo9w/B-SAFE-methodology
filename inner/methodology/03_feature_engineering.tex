\subsection{Feature Engineering}
\label{sec:feature_engineering}

To enable quantitative analysis and risk assessment, we constructed a comprehensive set of features from our incident dataset. These features capture both technical and economic aspects of each security incident.

\subsubsection{Financial Impact Features}
\textbf{Loss Normalization:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{USD Value at Time of Incident:} All financial losses were converted to USD using exchange rates at the time of the incident
    \item \textbf{Inflation Adjustment:} Historical losses were adjusted for inflation using CPI data
    \item \textbf{Relative Loss:} Loss as a percentage of total value locked (TVL) or market capitalization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact Categories:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Losses:} Immediate financial impact on users and protocols
    \item \textbf{Indirect Losses:} Market cap reduction, loss of user confidence, regulatory costs
    \item \textbf{Recovery Costs:} Expenses related to incident response and remediation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Features}
\textbf{Attack Complexity:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technical Sophistication:} Rated on a scale of 1-5 based on required expertise
    \item \textbf{Resource Requirements:} Computational, financial, or social engineering resources needed
    \item \textbf{Time to Exploit:} Duration from vulnerability discovery to successful exploitation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Defense Effectiveness:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Audit Status:} Whether the affected system had undergone security audits
    \item \textbf{Control Implementation:} Presence and effectiveness of defense mechanisms
    \item \textbf{Detection Time:} Time between attack initiation and detection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Temporal and Contextual Features}
\textbf{Timeline Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Incident Window:} Duration from attack initiation to resolution
    \item \textbf{Rescue Window:} Time available for emergency response and fund recovery
    \item \textbf{Market Conditions:} Cryptocurrency market state at time of incident
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Protocol Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chain Affiliation:} Primary blockchain platform affected
    \item \textbf{Protocol Type:} DeFi protocol category (DEX, lending, yield farming, etc.)
    \item \textbf{Development Stage:} Protocol maturity and user adoption level
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feature Validation}
To ensure feature quality and consistency:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross-Validation:} Multiple sources were used to verify feature values
    \item \textbf{Expert Review:} Technical features were validated by security experts
    \item \textbf{Statistical Checks:} Outliers and anomalies were identified and investigated
\end{itemize}
