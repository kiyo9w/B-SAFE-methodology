\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

While our methodology provides a comprehensive framework for blockchain security assessment, we acknowledge several limitations that may affect the completeness and accuracy of our analysis.

\subsubsection{Data Completeness}
\textbf{Reporting Bias:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Underreporting:} Many incidents may go unreported, particularly smaller attacks or those affecting less prominent protocols
    \item \textbf{Selective Reporting:} Incidents may be reported differently based on their impact, perpetrator identity, or media attention
    \item \textbf{Geographic Bias:} Incidents in certain regions may be underrepresented due to language barriers or reporting infrastructure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Verification Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anonymous Nature:} Blockchain's pseudonymous nature makes it difficult to verify all incident details
    \item \textbf{Cross-Chain Complexity:} Multi-chain attacks may be undercounted or misclassified
    \item \textbf{Time Delays:} Some incidents may take time to be discovered and reported
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Methodological Limitations}
\textbf{Classification Accuracy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inter-Rater Reliability:} Despite our multi-stage review process, some classification decisions may be subjective
    \item \textbf{Evolution of Attacks:} New attack vectors may not fit neatly into our existing classification schema
    \item \textbf{Multi-Vector Attacks:} Complex attacks spanning multiple layers may be difficult to classify accurately
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Risk Assessment Challenges:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Historical Bias:} Our risk scoring may be influenced by historical patterns that may not predict future threats
    \item \textbf{Context Dependence:} Risk levels may vary significantly based on specific protocol implementations
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Adversaries:} Attackers may adapt their strategies in response to improved defenses
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Limitations}
\textbf{Data Quality:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Incomplete Information:} Some incidents lack sufficient technical details for comprehensive analysis
    \item \textbf{Inconsistent Reporting:} Different sources may report the same incident with varying levels of detail
    \item \textbf{Verification Gaps:} Not all reported incidents can be independently verified
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis Scope:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform Coverage:} Our analysis focuses on major blockchain platforms and may miss emerging ecosystems
    \item \textbf{Temporal Scope:} The 2017-2024 timeframe may not capture the full evolution of blockchain security threats
    \item \textbf{Protocol Types:} Certain protocol categories may be overrepresented in our dataset
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{External Validity}
\textbf{Generalizability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Protocol-Specific Factors:} Our findings may not generalize to all blockchain protocols
    \item \textbf{Market Conditions:} Analysis during specific market conditions may not reflect long-term trends
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Environment:} Changes in regulatory landscape may affect attack patterns and reporting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future Applicability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology Evolution:} Rapid technological changes may render some of our findings obsolete
    \item \textbf{Emerging Threats:} New attack vectors may emerge that are not captured in our current framework
    \item \textbf{Defense Evolution:} Improved security practices may change the effectiveness of existing attack vectors
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mitigation Strategies}
To address these limitations, we have implemented several mitigation strategies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multiple Data Sources:} Cross-validation across multiple sources to reduce reporting bias
    \item \textbf{Expert Review:} Regular review by security experts to validate classifications
    \item \textbf{Continuous Updates:} Framework designed for ongoing updates as new threats emerge
    \item \textbf{Transparency:} Full disclosure of methodology and limitations to enable critical evaluation
\end{itemize}
